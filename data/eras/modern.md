# Modern Art (1900 - 1970)

## Historical Context

Modern art emerged in the early 20th century as artists radically questioned representation, form, and the purpose of art itself. This period encompassed two World Wars, the Russian Revolution, the Great Depression, and rapid technological change. Artists responded with unprecedented experimentation: Cubism fragmented space, Surrealism explored the unconscious, Abstract Expressionism rejected representation entirely. The era saw art's center shift from Paris to New York by the 1940s, as European artists fled fascism and America became a cultural superpower.

## Defining Characteristics

Modern art is defined by its relentless innovation and rejection of tradition. No single style dominated; instead, multiple movements coexisted and competed, united only by their break with the past.

- **Cubism** (Picasso, Braque): multi-perspective fragmentation of form
- **Surrealism** (Dalí, Magritte): dreamlike imagery and unconscious exploration
- **Abstract Expressionism** (Pollock, Rothko): gesture, spontaneity, pure abstraction
- **Conceptual shift**: idea becomes as important as execution
- **New materials and techniques**: collage, assemblage, ready-mades, industrial processes

## Major Artists & Works

- **Pablo Picasso** (1881-1973): *Guernica* (1937), *Les Demoiselles d'Avignon* (1907); Cubism co-founder and modern art icon
- **Salvador Dalí** (1904-1989): *The Persistence of Memory* (1931); Surrealist master of meticulous dream imagery
- **Auguste Rodin** (1840-1917): *The Thinker* (1904), *The Gates of Hell*; bridge from 19th-century to modern sculpture
- **Frank Lloyd Wright** (1867-1959): *Fallingwater* (1939), Guggenheim Museum; organic architecture integrating nature
- **Jackson Pollock** (1912-1956): *No. 5, 1948*; drip paintings embodying Abstract Expressionist spontaneity
- **Piet Mondrian** (1872-1944): *Composition* series; geometric abstraction reduced to primary colors and lines

## Cultural Impact

Modern art fundamentally transformed how we understand creativity, authorship, and aesthetic value. It established that art could be purely abstract, conceptual, or challenging rather than beautiful. Movements like Dada and Surrealism influenced literature, film, and advertising. Abstract Expressionism made America an art world leader. Modern art's legacy is the contemporary belief that anything can be art, that artists should constantly innovate, and that art serves as critical commentary on society rather than mere decoration.
