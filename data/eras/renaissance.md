# Renaissance (1400 - 1600)

## Historical Context

The Renaissance began in 14th-century Florence, Italy, marking a cultural rebirth after the Middle Ages. Wealthy merchant families like the Medici patronized arts and learning, while the rediscovery of Greek and Roman texts fueled humanism. This period coincided with major historical shifts: the fall of Constantinople (1453), Gutenberg's printing press (c.1440), and European exploration. The movement spread from Italy to Northern Europe by the late 15th century.

## Defining Characteristics

Renaissance art revolutionized representation through linear perspective, creating convincing spatial depth. Artists studied human anatomy directly, achieving naturalistic proportions and expressions in both painting and sculpture.

- **Linear perspective** and mathematical proportion (Brunelleschi, Alberti)
- **Anatomical accuracy** through observation and dissection
- **Humanism** balancing religious devotion with celebration of human potential
- **Oil painting techniques** (sfumato, chiaroscuro) for subtle tonal gradations
- **Classical themes** from mythology alongside Christian subjects

## Major Artists & Works

- **Leonardo da Vinci** (1452-1519): *Mona Lisa* (c.1503-1519), *The Last Supper* (1495-1498); polymath master of sfumato and scientific observation
- **Michelangelo Buonarroti** (1475-1564): *David* (1501-1504), Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508-1512); sculptor and painter of monumental human forms
- **Raphael Sanzio** (1483-1520): *School of Athens* (1509-1511); epitome of High Renaissance harmony and ideal beauty
- **Sandro Botticelli** (1445-1510): *The Birth of Venus* (c.1485); graceful mythological scenes

## Cultural Impact

The Renaissance established principles of realism, perspective, and humanism that dominated Western art for four centuries. Its revival of classical ideals influenced architecture, literature, and science, shaping the modern world's emphasis on individualism, empirical inquiry, and the dignity of human achievement. The period laid groundwork for the Baroque era and the Scientific Revolution.
