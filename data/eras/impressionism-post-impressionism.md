# Impressionism & Post-Impressionism (1860 - 1910)

## Historical Context

Impressionism emerged in 1860s Paris as a radical break from academic painting. Artists rejected studio work and Salon conventions, painting outdoors (en plein air) to capture fleeting light effects. The term "Impressionism" originated from Claude Monet's *Impression, Sunrise* (1872), initially used derisively by critics. By the 1880s, some Impressionists sought new directions, leading to Post-Impressionism—a diverse movement emphasizing personal expression, structure, or symbolic content over optical realism. This era coincided with rapid industrialization, urban transformation, and the rise of photography.

## Defining Characteristics

Impressionism prioritized optical phenomena—light, atmosphere, movement—over precise detail. Post-Impressionists built on this freedom but pursued varied goals: Cézanne sought underlying structure, Van Gogh emotional intensity, Gauguin symbolic simplification.

- **Broken brushstrokes** and visible paint application
- **Pure, unmixed colors** applied side-by-side (optical mixing)
- **Outdoor painting** capturing changing light and weather
- **Modern subjects**: urban leisure, cafés, trains, suburban landscapes
- **Post-Impressionist diversity**: geometric form (Cézanne), expressive color (Van Gogh), primitivism (Gauguin)

## Major Artists & Works

- **Claude Monet** (1840-1926): *Water Lilies* series, *Impression, Sunrise* (1872); master of light and atmosphere
- **Vincent van Gogh** (1853-1890): *The Starry Night* (1889), *Sunflowers* (1888); intense color and emotional brushwork
- **Paul Cézanne** (1839-1906): *Mont Sainte-Victoire* series; structural analysis prefiguring Cubism
- **Georges Seurat** (1859-1891): *A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte* (1884-1886); pointillist technique
- **Edgar Degas** (1834-1917): Ballet dancers and modern life scenes with innovative cropping

## Cultural Impact

Impressionism liberated painting from academic rules, establishing the artist's subjective vision as paramount. It paved the way for all modern art movements: Fauvism's color, Cubism's structure, Expressionism's emotion. Post-Impressionists directly inspired 20th-century abstraction. The movement also democratized art subjects, celebrating everyday moments rather than historical grandeur, and established the independent artist as a cultural ideal rather than a craftsman serving patrons.
